This project presents a comprehensive implementation of the kinematics, dynamics, trajectory planning, and a graphical user interface (GUI) using MATLAB App Designer for the ABB1600 robot arm.

## About the Project

The primary objective of this project was to develop a detailed kinematics and dynamics model for the ABB1600 robot arm, along with our custom trajectory planning algorithm. Additionally, we have integrated the functionality into a user-friendly GUI using MATLAB's App Designer, allowing users to interactively control the robot arm and visualize its movements.

## Features

- **Forward Kinematics:** Calculate the end-effector position and orientation given the joint angles.
- **Inverse Kinematics:** Determine the joint angles required to reach a specific end-effector position and orientation.
- **Velocity Kinematics:** Compute the end-effector velocity based on joint velocities.
- **Inverse Dynamics:** Calculate the joint torques required to achieve a desired end-effector motion.
- **Trajectory Planning:** Plan smooth and efficient trajectories from start to goal positions, optimizing the robot's path for accuracy and performance.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The MATLAB App Designer GUI provides an intuitive and interactive platform for users to control the robot arm, visualize its movements, and test different scenarios.

## You have a feature to add?

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/abb1600-robot-arm.git`.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system with App Designer support.

3. **Explore the Code:** Take a look at the source code in the `src` directory. You will find separate modules for kinematics, dynamics, trajectory planning, and the MATLAB App Designer GUI.

4. **Run the GUI:** Open MATLAB, navigate to the `src` directory, and run the main MATLAB file for the GUI to start the interactive application.
